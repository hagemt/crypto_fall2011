== Description ==

  Plouton is designed to be a secure client/server/gateway solution
  for managing simple banking transactions. Its protocol consists of
  Diffie-Hellman style key exchange atop a public key cryptosystem,
  with a discrete intermediatary element that may be built alongside
  the client and server to simulate compartmentalization of
  communication at boundary points of a computer network.

  Most importantly, this facilitates quality assurance through
  easing the implementation of performance testing and analysis
  of possible attack vectors. Its author(s) aim(s) to deliver
  reliable and transparent security features.

  Plouton leverages the readline, pthread, SQLite, and GnuTLS libraries.
